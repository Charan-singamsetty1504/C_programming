**Process Management**

Process is nothing but a program in execution

Example -  Work is a program and the work i was doing can be said as a process.

->Programming
->Debugging
->Testing

so on....

Process needs resources to complete its task
When the computer is given with the tasks and the execution of that tasks is a process
The program is loaded into the memory is known as the proces
and it as four types 
->Stack- Process Stack contains the temporary Data such as method/function, return address, and local variables
->heap - Dynamically allocated memory 
->Text - General Current activity representated by the value of program counter 

Process Life Cycle

1. Start - This is initial state 
2. Ready- The Process is ready to be assigned 
3. Running - Once the process has been assigned to a processor by the scheduler
4. Waiting - Process needs to be in waiting state when there is no resources
5. Terminated or Exit - Once, the process finshes its execution it will be terminated by the operating system 

-----------------------------------------------------------
Process control block

This represents a information about a specific process

->The operating system will create a data structure to store the information about the process 
->The process control block is kept in a memory area that is protected from the normal user access

Process Queues

Process Stage - The Condition of the Process States

Process Queue is used to hold the process related process control blocks, When the process make transition from one state to another state the pcb is un-linked and assigned to the other process 
with the help of process scheduling 

->Process Scheduling 

Scheduling removes a currently running job from the processor and picks another task to perform. Process Scheduling divides a process into stages: ready, waiting, and running.

There are two ways of scheduling:

1. Non-Preemptive: The resource cannot be withdrawn from a process in non-preemptive until the process has completed execution. Resources are switched when a running process quits and changes to a waiting state.

2. Preemptive: The operating system provides resources to a process for a set period in preemptive scheduling. During the allocation of resources, the process transitions from running to ready or from waiting to ready. This switching happens because the CPU may grant precedence to other processes and substitute the executing process with a higher priority process.
