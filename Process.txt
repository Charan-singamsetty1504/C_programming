**Process Management**

Process is nothing but a program in execution

Example -  Work is a program and the work i was doing can be said as a process.

->Programming
->Debugging
->Testing

so on....

Process needs resources to complete its task
When the computer is given with the tasks and the execution of that tasks is a process
The program is loaded into the memory is known as the proces
and it as four types 
->Stack- Process Stack contains the temporary Data such as method/function, return address, and local variables
->heap - Dynamically allocated memory 
->Text - General Current activity representated by the value of program counter 

Process Life Cycle

1. Start - This is initial state 
2. Ready- The Process is ready to be assigned 
3. Running - Once the process has been assigned to a processor by the scheduler
4. Waiting - Process needs to be in waiting state when there is no resources
5. Terminated or Exit - Once, the process finshes its execution it will be terminated by the operating system

Process control block

This represents a information about a specific process

->The operating system will create a data structure to store the information about the process 
->The process control block is kept in a memory area that is protected from the normal user access

Process Control Block is a data structure that contains information of the process related to it. The process control block is also known as a task control block, entry of the process table, etc.

It is very important for process management as the data structuring for processes is done in terms of the PCB. It also defines the current state of the operating system.

Structure of the Process Control Block
The process control stores many data items that are needed for efficient process management. Some of these data items are explained with the help of the given diagram −

The following are the data items −

Process State
This specifies the process state i.e. new, ready, running, waiting or terminated.

Process Number
This shows the number of the particular process.

Program Counter
This contains the address of the next instruction that needs to be executed in the process.

Registers
This specifies the registers that are used by the process. They may include accumulators, index registers, stack pointers, general purpose registers etc.

List of Open Files
These are the different files that are associated with the process

CPU Scheduling Information
The process priority, pointers to scheduling queues etc. is the CPU scheduling information that is contained in the PCB. This may also include any other scheduling parameters.

Memory Management Information
The memory management information includes the page tables or the segment tables depending on the memory system used. It also contains the value of the base registers, limit registers etc.

I/O Status Information
This information includes the list of I/O devices used by the process, the list of files etc.

Accounting information
The time limits, account numbers, amount of CPU used, process numbers etc. are all a part of the PCB accounting information.

Location of the Process Control Block
The process control block is kept in a memory area that is protected from the normal user access. This is done because it contains important process information. Some of the operating systems place the PCB at the beginning of the kernel stack for the process as it is a safe location.

***Process Control block (PCB) is a data structure that stores information of a process. PCBs are stored in specially reserved memory for the operating system known as kernel space.***
***Process Control Block (PCB) does not contain the boostrap program***
**The Number of process completed per unit time is known as Throughput.**

Degree of Multiprogramming - The Number of processes in Memory.

Process Stage - The Condition of the Process States

__Process__Queues___

Process Queue is used to hold the process related process control blocks, When the process make transition from one state to another state the pcb is un-linked and assigned to the other process with the help of process scheduling 

The Operating system manages various types of queues for each of the process states. The PCB related to the process is also stored in the queue of the same state. If the Process is moved from one state to another state then its PCB is also unlinked from the corresponding queue and added to the other state queue in which the transition is made.

1. Job Queue
In starting, all the processes get stored in the job queue. It is maintained in the secondary memory. The long term scheduler (Job scheduler) picks some of the jobs and put them in the primary memory.

2. Ready Queue
Ready queue is maintained in primary memory. The short term scheduler picks the job from the ready queue and dispatch to the CPU for the execution.

3. Waiting Queue
When the process needs some IO operation in order to complete its execution, OS changes the state of the process from running to waiting. The context (PCB) associated with the process gets stored on the waiting queue which will be used by the Processor when the process finishes the IO.

Scheduling removes a currently running job from the processor and picks another task to perform. Process Scheduling divides a process into stages: ready, waiting, and running.

There are two ways of scheduling:

1. Non-Preemptive: The resource cannot be withdrawn from a process in non-preemptive until the process has completed execution. Resources are switched when a running process quits and changes to a waiting state.

2. Preemptive: The operating system provides resources to a process for a set period in preemptive scheduling. During the allocation of resources, the process transitions from running to ready or from waiting to ready. This switching happens because the CPU may grant precedence to other processes and substitute the executing process with a higher priority process.

Types of Process Scheduling

1). Long-Term Scheduler

A long-term scheduler determines which system should process programs. It uses CPU Scheduling to select and load programs into memory for execution. It manages the degree of multiprogramming and offers a balanced combination of jobs such as I/O bound and CPU bound.

A steady degree of multiprogramming indicates that the average rate of initialization and the average rate of process departure from the system are equal. Many systems, such as time-sharing operating systems, do not have a long-term scheduler since it is only necessary when a process transitions from new to ready.

Example of a Long Term Scheduler

Consider a long-term scheduler that creates all I/O bound processes. In this case, the CPU will remain idle for most of the time and we will not be utilizing our CPU to its full potential. On the other hand, if a long-term scheduler creates all CPU-bound processes, then the I/O waiting for queue will remain idle for most of the time, the devices will remain unused, and the CPU will remain busy for a long time.

In these scenarios, we will not be utilizing the complete potential of our system. However, if the long term scheduler creates processes that have a perfect balance of both the CPU bound and I/O bound jobs, we will be utilizing the system to its full potential, hence reducing the process time.

2). Medium-Term Scheduler

Medium-term scheduling, which is part of swapping, removes programs from memory. It lowers the amount of multiprogramming and handles the switched-out processes. For enhancing the process mix, swapping is required.

The use of medium term scheduler is to improve multiprogramming by allowing multiple processes to reside in main memory by swapping out processes that are waiting (need I/O) or low priority processes and swapping in other processes that were in ready queue.

When a current process makes an I/O request, it is suspended, which cannot be performed. As a result, the suspended process is transferred to secondary storage to free up memory for other operations. This is known as switching, and the act of swapping is referred to as switched out or rolled out.

For example, in the round-robin process, after a fixed time quantum, the process is again sent to the ready state from the running state. So, these things are done with the help of Medium-Term schedulers.

3). Short-Term Scheduler
A short-term scheduler, often known as a CPU scheduler, boosts system performance based on a predefined set of parameters. This is the process's transition from the ready state to the operating state.

It chooses one of the many processes ready to be executed and assigns the CPU to one of them. It is speedier than long-term schedulers, and it is also known as a dispatcher since it decides which process will be run next.

Short-term scheduling involves selecting one of the processes from the ready queue and scheduling them for execution. This is done by the short-term scheduler. A scheduling algorithm is used to decide which process will be scheduled for execution next by the short-term scheduler.

For example, when a running process is interrupted and may be changed, the short-term scheduler must recalibrate and give the highest-priority job the green light.

(*). Context Switching

A context switching is the mechanism to store and restore the state or context of a CPU in Process Control block so that a process execution can be resumed from the same point at a later time. Using this technique, a context switcher enables multiple processes to share a single CPU. Context switching is an essential part of a multitasking operating system features.

When the scheduler switches the CPU from executing one process to execute another, the state from the current running process is stored into the process control block. After this, the state for the process to run next is loaded from its own PCB and used to set the PC, registers, etc. At that point, the second process can start executing.

Context switches are computationally intensive since register and memory state must be saved and restored. To avoid the amount of context switching time, some hardware systems employ two or more sets of processor registers. When the process is switched, the following information is stored for later use.

Program Counter
Scheduling information
Base and limit register value
Currently used register
Changed State
I/O State information
Accounting information

The need for Context switching
A context switching helps to share a single CPU across all processes to complete its execution and store the system's tasks status. When the process reloads in the system, the execution of the process starts at the same point where there is conflicting.

Following are the reasons that describe the need for context switching in the Operating system.

The switching of one process to another process is not directly in the system. A context switching helps the operating system that switches between the multiple processes to use the CPU's resource to accomplish its tasks and store its context. We can resume the service of the process at the same point later. If we do not store the currently running process's data or context, the stored data may be lost while switching between processes.
If a high priority process falls into the ready queue, the currently running process will be shut down or stopped by a high priority process to complete its tasks in the system.
If any running process requires I/O resources in the system, the current process will be switched by another process to use the CPUs. And when the I/O requirement is met, the old process goes into a ready state to wait for its execution in the CPU. Context switching stores the state of the process to resume its tasks in an operating system. Otherwise, the process needs to restart its execution from the initials level.
If any interrupts occur while running a process in the operating system, the process status is saved as registers using context switching. After resolving the interrupts, the process switches from a wait state to a ready state to resume its execution at the same point later, where the operating system interrupted occurs.
A context switching allows a single CPU to handle multiple process requests simultaneously without the need for any additional processors.

Example of Context Switching
Suppose that multiple processes are stored in a Process Control Block (PCB). One process is running state to execute its task with the use of CPUs. As the process is running, another process arrives in the ready queue, which has a high priority of completing its task using CPU. Here we used context switching that switches the current process with the new process requiring the CPU to finish its tasks. While switching the process, a context switch saves the status of the old process in registers. When the process reloads into the CPU, it starts the execution of the process when the new process stops the old process. If we do not save the state of the process, we have to start its execution at the initial level. In this way, context switching helps the operating system to switch between the processes, store or reload the process when it requires executing its tasks.

Context switching triggers
Following are the three types of context switching triggers as follows.

Interrupts
Multitasking
Kernel/User switch
Interrupts: A CPU requests for the data to read from a disk, and if there are any interrupts, the context switching automatic switches a part of the hardware that requires less time to handle the interrupts.

Multitasking: A context switching is the characteristic of multitasking that allows the process to be switched from the CPU so that another process can be run. When switching the process, the old state is saved to resume the process's execution at the same point in the system.

Kernel/User Switch: It is used in the operating systems when switching between the user mode, and the kernel/user mode is performed.

What is the PCB?
A PCB (Process Control Block) is a data structure used in the operating system to store all data related information to the process. For example, when a process is created in the operating system, updated information of the process, switching information of the process, terminated process in the PCB.

Steps for Context Switching
There are several steps involves in context switching of the processes. The following diagram represents the context switching of two processes, P1 to P2, when an interrupt, I/O needs, or priority-based process occurs in the ready queue of PCB.
As we can see in the diagram, initially, the P1 process is running on the CPU to execute its task, and at the same time, another process, P2, is in the ready state. If an error or interruption has occurred or the process requires input/output, the P1 process switches its state from running to the waiting state. Before changing the state of the process P1, context switching saves the context of the process P1 in the form of registers and the program counter to the PCB1. After that, it loads the state of the P2 process from the ready state of the PCB2 to the running state.

The following steps are taken when switching Process P1 to Process 2:
First, thes context switching needs to save the state of process P1 in the form of the program counter and the registers to the PCB (Program Counter Block), which is in the running state.
Now update PCB1 to process P1 and moves the process to the appropriate queue, such as the ready queue, I/O queue and waiting queue.
After that, another process gets into the running state, or we can select a new process from the ready state, which is to be executed, or the process has a high priority to execute its task.
Now, we have to update the PCB (Process Control Block) for the selected process P2. It includes switching the process state from ready to running state or from another state like blocked, exit, or suspend.
If the CPU already executes process P2, we need to get the status of process P2 to resume its execution at the same time point where the system interrupt occurs.
Similarly, process P2 is switched off from the CPU so that the process P1 can resume execution. P1 process is reloaded from PCB1 to the running state to resume its task at the same point. Otherwise, the information is lost, and when the process is executed again, it starts execution at the initial level.
