Process is nothing but a program in execution

Example -  Work is a program and the work i was doing can be said as a process.

->Programming
->Debugging
->Testing

so on....

Process needs resources to complete its task
When the computer is given with the tasks and the execution of that tasks is a process
The program is loaded into the memory is known as the proces
and it as four types 
->Stack- Process Stack contains the temporary Data such as method/function, return address, and local variables
->heap - Dynamically allocated memory 
->Text - General Current activity representated by the value of program counter 
->Data - This section contains the global static variables
------------------------------------------------------------
Process Life Cycle

1. Start - This is initial state 
2. Ready- The Process is ready to be assigned 
3. Running - Once the process has been assigned to a processor by the scheduler
4. Waiting - Process needs to be in waiting state when there is no resources
5. Terminated or Exit - Once, the process finshes its execution it will be terminated by the operating system 

-----------------------------------------------------------
Process control block

This represents a information about a specific process

->The operating system will create a data structure to store the information about the process 
->The process control block is kept in a memory area that is protected from the normal user access
