**Process Management**

Process is nothing but a program in execution

Example -  Work is a program and the work i was doing can be said as a process.

->Programming
->Debugging
->Testing

so on....

Process needs resources to complete its task
When the computer is given with the tasks and the execution of that tasks is a process
The program is loaded into the memory is known as the proces
and it as four types 
->Stack- Process Stack contains the temporary Data such as method/function, return address, and local variables
->heap - Dynamically allocated memory 
->Text - General Current activity representated by the value of program counter 

Process Life Cycle

1. Start - This is initial state 
2. Ready- The Process is ready to be assigned 
3. Running - Once the process has been assigned to a processor by the scheduler
4. Waiting - Process needs to be in waiting state when there is no resources
5. Terminated or Exit - Once, the process finshes its execution it will be terminated by the operating system 

-----------------------------------------------------------
Process control block

This represents a information about a specific process

->The operating system will create a data structure to store the information about the process 
->The process control block is kept in a memory area that is protected from the normal user access

Process Queues

Process Stage - The Condition of the Process States

Process Queue is used to hold the process related process control blocks, When the process make transition from one state to another state the pcb is un-linked and assigned to the other process 
with the help of process scheduling 

->Process Scheduling 

Scheduling removes a currently running job from the processor and picks another task to perform. Process Scheduling divides a process into stages: ready, waiting, and running.

There are two ways of scheduling:

1. Non-Preemptive: The resource cannot be withdrawn from a process in non-preemptive until the process has completed execution. Resources are switched when a running process quits and changes to a waiting state.

2. Preemptive: The operating system provides resources to a process for a set period in preemptive scheduling. During the allocation of resources, the process transitions from running to ready or from waiting to ready. This switching happens because the CPU may grant precedence to other processes and substitute the executing process with a higher priority process.

Types of Process Scheduling

1). Long-Term Scheduler

A long-term scheduler determines which system should process programs. It uses CPU Scheduling to select and load programs into memory for execution. It manages the degree of multiprogramming and offers a balanced combination of jobs such as I/O bound and CPU bound.

A steady degree of multiprogramming indicates that the average rate of initialization and the average rate of process departure from the system are equal. Many systems, such as time-sharing operating systems, do not have a long-term scheduler since it is only necessary when a process transitions from new to ready.

Example of a Long Term Scheduler

Consider a long-term scheduler that creates all I/O bound processes. In this case, the CPU will remain idle for most of the time and we will not be utilizing our CPU to its full potential. On the other hand, if a long-term scheduler creates all CPU-bound processes, then the I/O waiting for queue will remain idle for most of the time, the devices will remain unused, and the CPU will remain busy for a long time.

In these scenarios, we will not be utilizing the complete potential of our system. However, if the long term scheduler creates processes that have a perfect balance of both the CPU bound and I/O bound jobs, we will be utilizing the system to its full potential, hence reducing the process time.

2). Medium-Term Scheduler

Medium-term scheduling, which is part of swapping, removes programs from memory. It lowers the amount of multiprogramming and handles the switched-out processes. For enhancing the process mix, swapping is required.

The use of medium term scheduler is to improve multiprogramming by allowing multiple processes to reside in main memory by swapping out processes that are waiting (need I/O) or low priority processes and swapping in other processes that were in ready queue.

When a current process makes an I/O request, it is suspended, which cannot be performed. As a result, the suspended process is transferred to secondary storage to free up memory for other operations. This is known as switching, and the act of swapping is referred to as switched out or rolled out.

For example, in the round-robin process, after a fixed time quantum, the process is again sent to the ready state from the running state. So, these things are done with the help of Medium-Term schedulers.

3). Short-Term Scheduler
A short-term scheduler, often known as a CPU scheduler, boosts system performance based on a predefined set of parameters. This is the process's transition from the ready state to the operating state.

It chooses one of the many processes ready to be executed and assigns the CPU to one of them. It is speedier than long-term schedulers, and it is also known as a dispatcher since it decides which process will be run next.
